    <h1>q1forEach(), Map (), filter(), Find() Difference</h1>
    <p>Ans: <br>
         .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and
        it returns undefined. <br> <br>
        .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        <br><br>
        .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with
        the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
        <br><br>
        The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. Also The find() method executes a
        function for each array element.
